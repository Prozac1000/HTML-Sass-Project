                <label for="item-1"><span></span>1: Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe
                    the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
                    website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to
                    those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi
                    Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the
                    country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New
                    Orleans.

                <label for="item-2"><span></span>2: When does Mardi Gras start and end?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras
                    day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                    Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                    Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

                <label for="item-3"><span></span>3: What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I
                    pack?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will
                    change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes
                    since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                    Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                    somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll
                    definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                    by?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers
                    a balcony, food and a bathroom pass.

                <article class="acc-art">
                    It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we
                    call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"

                <label for="item-6"><span></span>6: I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during
                    Mardi Gras?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the
                    weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets
                    of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can
                    stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience
                    Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras
                    festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
                    costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                <article class="acc-art">
                    The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be
                    severe. The local TV and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour by hour updates.

                <input type="checkbox" id="item-8" class="accordion"></input>
                <label for="item-8"><span></span>8: Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us
                    who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to
                    every parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large
                    garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals,
                    beads and more.

                    The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                    anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon, since
                    parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles
                    is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having
                    picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about
                    the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                    You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like Metairie,
                    which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi
                    Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                    arrived?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental car
                    depending on where you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult.

                <label for="item-10"><span></span>10: Where should I go if someone needs CPR or first aid during a
                    parade?</label>
                <article class="acc-art">
                    Red Cross volunteers, in partnership with New Orleans first responders, will be providing basic
                    first aid in some of the most populated areas along the parade routes. They are trained in CPR and
                    first aid and will assist the ill and injured at each of their stations positioned along the parade
                    routes.

                    First aid stations will be available on the following corners along St. Charles Avenue during many
                    of our larger parades the last two weeks of Mardi Gras season:

                    Canal Street | Napoleon Avenue | Washington Avenue | Felicity Street | Lee Circle
                    Additionally, first aid stations will be available at Orleans Avenue and North Hennessy Street, as
                    well as North Carrolton Avenue and Bienville Street on the Saturday before Mardi Gras for the
                    Endymion parade.
