                    <p>
                        the holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                        Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
                        before
                        Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
                        parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most
                        elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week,
                        many
                        events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
                        (some
                        of them masquerade balls).

                        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                        parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of
                        Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
                        krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion
                        (which is
                        best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
                        (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                        Pleasure
                        Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the
                        crowds.
                        The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic
                        "throw
                        cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and
                        route
                        each year.

                        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                        originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and
                        Canal
                        Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
                        Vieux
                        and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
                        weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
                        the
                        Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                        LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as
                        the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. A Democrat,
                        Cantrell is the first woman to hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell
                        represented
                        District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.

                        Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position
                        in
                        the city's history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and
                        Families,with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the
                        city.
                        Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding solutions to
                        violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city
                        for
                        city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city
                        infrastructure,
                        public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in
                        October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers
                        and
                        distributors.

                        During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                        Agreement with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The
                        agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as
                        well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of
                        the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor
                        Cantrell
                        and the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a
                        $500
                        million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment
                        of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
